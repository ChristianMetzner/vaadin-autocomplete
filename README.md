Vaadin autocomplete addon
=========================

To start the demo application, launch the following command in the `code`
directory:

    # Compiles the widgetset. Only needed the first time
    mvn package
    mvn jetty:run

To develop you may also want to run the GWT code server:

    mvn vaadin:run-codeserver
